### Abstract
Analytical tasks in various domains increasingly encode complex information as dense vector data (e.g., embeddings), often requiring filtered vector search (i.e., vector search with attribute filtering). This search is challenging due to the volume and dimensionality of the data, the number and variety of filters, and the difference in distribution and/or update frequency between vectors and filters. Besides, many real applications require answers in a few milliseconds with high recall on large collections. Graph-based methods are considered the best choice for such applications, despite a lack of theoretical guarantees on query accuracy. Existing solutions for filtered vector search are either: 1) ad-hoc, using existing techniques with no or minor modifications; or 2) hybrid, providing specialized indexing and/or search algorithms. We show that neither is satisfactory and propose RWalks, an index-agnostic graph-based filtered vector search method that efficiently supports both filtered and unfiltered vector search. We demonstrate its scalability and robustness against the state-of-the-art with an exhaustive experimental evaluation on four real datasets (up to 100 million vectors), using query workloads with filters of different types (unique/composite), and varied specificity (proportion of points that satisfy a filter). The results show that RWalks can perform filtered search up to 2x faster than the second-best competitor (ACORN), while building the index 76x faster and answering unfiltered search 13x faster.

## Data Download

Before running experiments, you need to download the required datasets:

### Available Datasets

1. **SIFT-1M**: `sift_1m_old_dist.h5` 
2. **YFCC-10M**: `yfcc10m_old_dist.h5`

### Download Instructions

1. Download the datasets:
   - **SIFT-1M**: [Download from MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/H1hnXDIK#i_F9chhKiLU3lABfyKXH22AKfK1cwX10k6pztu1jKv4)
   - **YFCC-10M**: [Download from MEGA](https://mega.nz/file/TsIDhACT#xbiaR659J2ec3P4KubmbRvtLub09TcLsdr-Eu5bomb0)
2. **Remember the full path** to your data files as you'll need it for running experiments.

## üõ† Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnasAito/rwalks-reproduce
cd rwalks-reproduce
```

### 2. Create and Activate Python Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate 
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Verify Installation

Test that everything is installed correctly:
```bash
python -c "import hnswlib; print('RWalks installed successfully!')"
```

## üß™ Running Experiments

### Basic Usage

Run experiments using the `specificity.py` script with your dataset and chosen search method:

```bash
python experiments/specificity.py --data_src_path /path/to/your/data/sift_1m_old_dist.h5 --search_mode <method>
```

### Methods supported

```bash
# Test with RWalks method
python experiments/specificity.py --data_src_path /data/anas.aitaomar/sift_1m_old_dist.h5 --search_mode rwalks

# Test with HNSW baseline
python experiments/specificity.py --data_src_path /data/anas.aitaomar/sift_1m_old_dist.h5 --search_mode hnsw-inline

# Test with STF method
python experiments/specificity.py --data_src_path /data/anas.aitaomar/sift_1m_old_dist.h5 --search_mode stf

# Test with ACORN methods
python experiments/specificity.py --data_src_path /data/anas.aitaomar/sift_1m_old_dist.h5 --search_mode acorn-1
python experiments/specificity.py --data_src_path /data/anas.aitaomar/sift_1m_old_dist.h5 --search_mode acorn-g
```

### What Happens During Experiments

Each experiment will:

1. **Load the dataset** from your specified `.h5` file
2. **Build search indices** 
3. **Run queries** across multiple specificity levels (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5)
4. **Test various EF values** (10-500 for most methods, 10-50 for HNSW-Inline as it saturates)
5. **Measure performance** (queries per second, recall)
6. **Save results** to `data/specificity_experiment_{dataset}_{method}.csv`

## üìä Visualization

### Generate Performance Plots

After running experiments, visualize the results:

```bash
python experiments/specificity_plot.py --data_src_path /path/to/your/data/sift_1m_old_dist.h5
```

### Plot Features

The visualization script will:

- **Load all available results** from your experiments
- **Generate QPS vs Recall plots** for each specificity level
- **Show Pareto frontiers** comparing different methods
- **Save plots** to `data/qps_vs_recall_pareto_{dataset}.png`
You will get a plot similar to this:

export RWALKS_EF_CONSTRUCTION=100
export RWALKS_M=16
export RWALKS_PRUN_FACTOR=0.0

# ACORN parameters
export ACORN_GAMMA=10
export ACORN_M=16
export ACORN_MB=32
```
### Hardware Requirements
